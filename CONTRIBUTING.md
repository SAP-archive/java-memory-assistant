# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](code-of-conduct), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Contribute Code

You are welcome to contribute code to the Java Memory Assistant in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

There are three important things to know:

1. You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and agree to the Contributors License Agreement.
   This is common practice in all major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using the [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) for individual contributions.
   CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click-experience for accepting the CLA.
   For company contributors, [special rules apply](company-contributors).
   See the respective section below for details.
2. There are several requirements regarding code style, quality, and product standards which need to be met (we also have to follow them).
   The respective section below gives more details on the coding guidelines.
3. Not all proposed contributions can be accepted.
   Some features may, e.g., just fit a third-party add-on better.
   The code must fit the overall direction of Java Memory Assistant and really improve it, so there should be some "bang for the byte".
   For most bug fixes this is a given, but major feature implementation first need to be discussed with one of the Java Memory Assistant committers by opening an issue on the project.

### Pull Request Process

This a checklist of things to keep in your mind when opening pull requests for this project.

0. Validate your pull request with a local build using as many supported JDKs you can for running
   the end-to-end tests
1. Ensure all unused dependencies are removed opening the pull request
2. Make sure any added dependency is licensed under Apache v2.0 license
3. Strive for very high unit-test coverage and favor testing productive code over mocks
   (mock in depth wherever possible)
4. When adding a new functionality to the agent, write an end-to-end test for it
   (package `test-e2e`)
5. Update the README.md with details of changes to the configuration options

Pull requests will be tested and validated by maintainers. In case small changes are needed (e.g.,
correcting typos), the maintainers may fix those issues themselves. In case of larger issues, you
may be asked to apply modifications to your changes before the Pull Request can be merged.

### Contributor License Agreement

When you contribute (code, documentation, or anything else), you have to be aware that your contribution is covered by the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that is applied to the Java Memory Assistant itself.
Also, you need to agree to the Individual Contributor License Agreement, which can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/CLAassistant/bd1ea8ec8aa0357414e8).
(This applies to all contributors, including those contributing on behalf of a company).
If you agree to its content, you simply have to click on the link posted by the CLA assistant as a comment to the pull request.
Click it to check the CLA, then accept it on the following screen if you agree to it.
CLA assistant will save this decision for upcoming contributions and will notify you if there is any change to the CLA in the meantime.

#### Company Contributors

If employees of a company contribute code, in **addition** to the individual agreement above, there needs to be one company agreement submitted.
This is mainly for the protection of the contributing employees.

A company representative authorized to do so needs to download, fill, and print
the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/master/docs/SAP Corporate Contributor License Agreement.pdf) form. Then either:

-   Scan it and e-mail it to [opensource@sap.com](mailto:opensource@sap.com)
-   Fax it to: +49 6227 78-45813
-   Send it by traditional letter to: *Industry Standards & Open Source Team, Dietmar-Hopp-Allee 16, 69190 Walldorf, Germany*

The form contains a list of employees who are authorized to contribute on behalf of your company.
When this list changes, please let us know.
